## Public Disclosure of Architecture

This document constitutes a dated public disclosure of the architecture and
methodology described below, establishing prior art as of the date above.

## Concept

This repository discloses a framework for **constitutional stress-testing** of
statutes, bills, referenda, and judicial decisions. The framework converts legal
text into controlled intermediate representations and formal ACL2
theorem-prover models that mechanically derive the assumptions required to prove
or disprove constitutional conflict.

The architecture enforces a strict separation between:

1. **Source-text facts** — propositions directly stated in the enacted or
   proposed legal text, labeled `TEXT_FACT`, `DEFINED_TERM`, `PROHIBITION`,
   `EXCEPTION`, `PENALTY`, or `PROCEDURAL_FACT`.

2. **Applications of defined terms** — propositions that apply a statutory
   definition to a specific object or scenario, labeled
   `APPLICATION_OF_DEFINED_TERM`.

3. **Empirical and technical classifications** — factual claims requiring
   evidence or expertise outside the legal text, labeled `EMPIRICAL_FACT` or
   `TECHNICAL_CLASSIFICATION`.

4. **Challenger interpretive assumptions** — assumptions favoring a
   constitutional challenge, labeled `INTERPRETATION_CHALLENGER` or
   `DOCTRINAL_ASSUMPTION`.

5. **Government (or Commonwealth) interpretive assumptions** — assumptions
   favoring defense of the law, labeled `INTERPRETATION_GOVERNMENT` or
   `POLICY_ASSUMPTION`.

6. **ACL2 proof obligations** — formal theorems that the prover attempts under
   each model's axioms, establishing whether constitutional conflict follows
   from the model's assumptions.

## Method

The workflow proceeds through a pipeline of specialized agents:

1. **Source Locator** — identifies and retrieves authoritative legal text.
2. **Parser** — splits text into structured sections with source provenance.
3. **Legal Structure Agent** — extracts definitions, prohibitions, exceptions,
   penalties, and procedural provisions.
4. **ACE Normalization Agent** — converts extracted clauses into Attempto
   Controlled English (ACE) statements, validated against the Attempto Parsing
   Engine (APE) where available, producing an auditable bridge between raw legal
   text and formal predicates.
5. **Predicate Extraction Agent** — converts normalized clauses into ACL2-ready
   predicates with source labels, confidence scores, and human-review flags.
6. **Constitutional Matcher** — maps statutory burdens against constitutional
   interests, proposes conflict predicates, and separates text facts from
   interpretive bridge rules.
7. **ACL2 Generation Agent** — emits four ACL2 books:
   - `*_core.lisp` — neutral vocabulary and generic conflict conditions
   - `*_facts.lisp` — text-derived axioms only
   - `*_challenger_model.lisp` — challenge-side interpretive assumptions
   - `*_government_model.lisp` — defense-side interpretive assumptions
8. **Proof Runner** — executes each model in an independent ACL2 session and
   records which theorems proved, which failed, and which assumptions were
   needed for each result.
9. **Report Agent** — produces human-readable analysis identifying the
   interpretive hinges, statutory ambiguities, and proof-controlling assumptions.

## Key Design Principles

- **The system does not decide constitutionality.** It identifies which
  assumptions are necessary to prove conflict or no conflict under competing
  legal theories.

- **Facts and interpretations are never mixed.** Every assertion carries a
  provenance label. Interpretive assumptions are quarantined in model-specific
  files and are never placed in the facts file.

- **Competing models are never loaded together.** The challenger and government
  models derive opposite conclusions and are intentionally incompatible. They
  run in separate ACL2 sessions.

- **Statutory ambiguities are surfaced, not resolved.** Where the enacted text
  does not clearly answer a constitutional question, the system identifies the
  ambiguity, shows how each model resolves it, and reports the interpretive
  distance each model travels from the plain text.

- **ACE normalization provides an auditable intermediate layer.** Before
  predicates are extracted, legal clauses are rewritten into controlled English
  and validated against a parser. This exposes hidden interpretation and
  preserves exact statutory thresholds.

## Scope of Disclosure

This disclosure covers:

- The overall architecture of separated fact/interpretation/proof layers
- The use of ACL2 as the theorem prover for constitutional reasoning
- The ACE/APE normalization pipeline as an intermediate representation
- The labeling taxonomy (TEXT_FACT through HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED)
- The dual-model proof strategy (challenger vs. government)
- The interpretive-distance analysis methodology
- The statutory-ambiguity identification and binary-fact residual analysis
- The application of this framework to any jurisdiction's statutes, bills,
  constitutional provisions, referenda, or judicial decisions
